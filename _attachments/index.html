it's not convenient and it's not fair 
you fear the world too much
you've changed.
You mean to say you took them down while he was lying there
somebody was fool enough to put it on him, to be buried in, but I took it, of him
he frightened everyone away while he was alive
only to profit us
did you do all this things
 </p>

time to study
define economics
economics is the science that deals the production , distribution and consumption of commodities 
translation:
dig first money later.
Whom are you fighting?
Who do you think?
So neglect becomes our ally
compute this
for I would quickly lose control of whole crew 
someday I may come to find you 
a man is always in need of a good friend 
Than I shall become a count.
Get off my property, you vagabond
I am sure that within a month, you will not even remember my name hmm?
for the waltz.
how did I plan this moment?
Why are you doing this? It's complicated
call it mercy

Would I be disturbing you if I joined you 
no, no,. please disturb me
About the psychology of the criminal. The "why?‚Äù
sometimes things hide in plain sight
you expect us to believe...? 
..it's just that sometimes when I speak so forcefully people just crack, instantly.
Now, let me reconstruct the crime.
You came into the room when?
And what was the first thing you did?
The moon that night was so beautiful. It made me close to the Lord (world) 
i'm picking up on something. You're very spiritual man , aren't you? 
It's part of my job to read people. I, think i'm quite good, at it too.
Ahh, you know if you organized your closets by color it would save you time in your rush to get to work in the morning 
it's what I do , and it saves me time. 
Now in order to better visualize the crime i'm going to place myself in your position 
I walk out on to the balcony 
I am now out on the balcony
now, you see why it's important to re-create the events
or perhaps the thief was hiding in a ledge or recess

the art is for me to feed pieces to you and make you believe you took those pieces, because you are smarter and I am dumber. 
In every game and con there is always an opponent and there is always a victim. 
The more control the victim has, the less control he actually has. 
I, as the opponent, just help him along. 
The formula has infinite depth in it's efficacy and application, but it is staggeringly simple and completely consistent. 
Rule one of any game or con: you can only get smarter by playing a smarter opponent. 
Eventually , when the opponent is challenged or questioned,it means the victim's investment and thus his intelligence is questioned. No-one can accept that , not even to themselves.
You've got more tricks than a clown's pocket, don't you mr. green? 
They're the last resort. when no other loan sharks will lend them, this boys move in. 
no-one lives and displeases gold no-one but your two friends
got to be something wrong if gold won't touch'em .
No-one sees gold , but gold sees everything
