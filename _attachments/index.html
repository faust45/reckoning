      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 36pt; line-height: 190%;"><span
 lang="EN-CA">Deception is overwhelmingly common.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
its most minor, inconsequential form,
deception is an everyday part of social life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
example answering &#8220;very well, thank you&#8221; to the
question &#8220;how are
you?&#8221; when one is in a foul mood or not feeling too well is deception,
though
relatively unserious. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>A very broad
definition of deception might even consider wearing makeup to be
deception.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then at the other end of the
spectrum, outright falsifications have the power to be exceedingly
important
and can result in very serious consequences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
serious deception is discovered, not only are there
often severe social
consequences such as termination of friendships or romantic
involvements, but
there can be monetary and even legal consequences, for example if a
person was
caught lying on a tax return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
consequences of deception can range from trivial to life changing, for
both the
deceiver and the deceived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 36pt; line-height: 190%;"><span
 lang="EN-CA">As suggested above, deception can take many forms.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The most common and least offensive is the
white lie &#8211; a small lie relating to an unimportant matter to be polite.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Omission involves intentional failure to
disclose significant information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Blatant
lying, or falsification, is deliberate
communication of
information that is known by the deceiver to be untrue.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>Distortion bends the truth, either
exaggerating or minimizing facts to mislead the target of the deception.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 36pt; line-height: 190%;"><span
 lang="EN-CA">As children, most people are taught that lying is
wrong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, in the context of close
relationships, and in particular, within romantic relationships when
honesty is
often considered to be the foundation of mutual trust and satisfaction,
the use
of deception is remarkably common.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
fact, 92% of people can remember lying to their significant other
(Cole,
2001).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But why would people knowingly
engage in a behaviour that is considered morally wrong, and so socially
undesirable, especially when the consequences can be so serious?<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>In my opinion, most forms of deception are
hurtful, and therefore deceiving another could be considered an
aggressive
act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wish to understand how
individuals justify their deceptive behaviour toward those they are
supposed to
care about the most.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The aim of this
paper is to investigate the use of deception in close relationships,
the
consequences of deception in romantic relationships, the reasons behind
it, and
how deception is discovered. </span></p>

of relationships</span></i><span lang="EN-CA">:</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 36pt; line-height: 190%;"><span
 lang="EN-CA">Metts (1989) did a study to investigate deception within
close relationships.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were two main
purposes to the research.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Previous
research suggests that individuals in developing relationships, when
there is
an attempt to learn more about each other (high information seeking),
falsification (outright dishonesty) and distortion (&#8220;bending&#8221; of the
truth) are
more common than in established relationships when information seeking
is less
common or in friendships when the demand for intimacy isn&#8217;t as strong,
and in
those types of relationships omission (intentional failure to disclose
all
pertinent information) would be the more common type of deception.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>To investigate the extent to which the type
of deception is related to the type of relationship was the first
purpose of
the study.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second purpose of the
study was to determine what reasons for deception are common in close
relationships, and to see if any reasons characterize specific types of
relationships. <span style="color: maroon;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 190%;"><span lang="EN-CA"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>To answer these
questions, the results of 357 questionnaires completed by American
university
students were coded and analysed. The study found that falsification
was the
most common type of deception in close relationships, and the most
frequent
reason for deception was avoiding hurt to the partner.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>Within married couples, they found
proportionately more occurrences of omission and less instances of
falsification than compared to other types of relationships.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>In terms of the reasons for deception, dating
couples reported more reasons aimed at protecting their resources,
avoiding
stress or abuse from their partner, and avoiding damage to or
termination of
the relationship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Married couples on the
other hand, were more likely to deceive their partner in order to
protect the
partner&#8217;s face/self-esteem.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, the
study found that partner-focussed reasons (protecting the partner from
pain, as
opposed to protecting the relationship) were related to high levels of
relational satisfaction, closeness and perceived partner commitment. </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 36pt; line-height: 190%;"><span
 lang="EN-CA">One criticism of this study involves the method used to
elicit information about the participant&#8217;s own deception.<span style="">&nbsp;

      </span>The use of the word &#8220;lying&#8221; may have led to
an overestimation of cases of blatant lies (falsifications), as
omissions and
distortions may not be as closely connected to the meaning of the word
lie as
falsifications are (Coleman &amp; Kay, 1981, as cited in Peterson,
1996).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, as is common in psychology
research, the
study was based on a sample consisting of university students and a few
other
adults, and this brings into question the relevance of the study&#8230; Do
the
results apply to all communities, or are they specific to the
university
world?<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 36pt; line-height: 190%;"><span
 lang="EN-CA">Further research could investigate the point at which
dating couples begin to use less falsification and become more
concerned about
the partner&#8217;s face rather than protecting resources.<span style="">&nbsp;

      </span>It would also be interesting if the study had
included an investigation of deception before couples were actually
dating
(courtship phase), however realistically, this would probably be
impossible in
terms of recruiting participants. Overall, however, this study provided
insights into the use of deception in romantic relationships at a time
when the
focus of research on close relationships was based on openness and
self-disclosure, and research on deception focussed on children and
dishonesty
between strangers (Peterson 1996). </span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 36pt; line-height: 190%;"><span
 lang="EN-CA">We now know the types of deception that are common in
various stages of relationship development, but how do different types
of
deception relate to relational satisfaction and commitment?<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 36pt; line-height: 190%;"><span
 lang="EN-CA">Peterson (1996) elaborated the research of deception in
intimate relationships by investigating the frequency of use of 6
categories of
deception (blatant lying, distortion, omission, half-truths, attempted
deception and white lying), exploring the relationship between
frequency of the
6 lie types by each partner and the level of relational satisfaction.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Peterson also investigated how adults morally
evaluate the 6 types of deception by intimate partners, whether any
relationship existed between relational satisfaction and the use of
deception
to avoid conflict, and if so, if it is a better predictor of relational
satisfaction than frequency of deception alone.</span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 36pt; line-height: 190%;"><span
 lang="EN-CA">The study analysed the results of questionnaires
completed by 80 Australian university students.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Peterson
found that each type of deception, excluding
white lies, was
considered morally reprehensible in terms of blame, guilt and
dishonesty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of the 6 types of deception,
white lies were
used most frequently and blatant lies least frequently.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>Relationship satisfaction decreased with
frequent use of deception, by either partner, excluding white lies. It
was also
found that couples who believed lying was preferable to arguing lied
more
frequently, using deception as a form of conflict avoidance. <span
 style="">&nbsp;</span>A very interesting, though indirect, finding
of this research is that individuals in intimate relationships are more
likely
to excuse their own unsuccessful attempts to lie than their partner&#8217;s.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>They consider their own attempts at deception
to be less blameworthy and morally reprehensible than their partner&#8217;s,
and this
is a clear double standard.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 36pt; line-height: 190%;"><span
 lang="EN-CA">The most useful finding of this study however is that
couples who were the most satisfied with their relationships were the
least
likely to behave deceptively, and perceived their partner as being
honest as
well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This suggests that open and honest
communication is very important in healthy, satisfying intimate
relationships. </span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 36pt; line-height: 190%;"><span
 lang="EN-CA">The results of this study provide some fascinating
elaborations of previous research, in particular the relationship
between
relational satisfaction and frequency of deception as well as use of
deception
as conflict avoidance and relational satisfaction, which, as suggested
by the
author, could be useful in marriage counselling settings.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>Also of potential practical applicability in
counselling settings is the effect of the partner&#8217;s perceived deception
and
relationship quality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 36pt; line-height: 190%;"><span
 lang="EN-CA">However, further research on these topics is
necessary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In particular, the results of
the study should be investigated within more representative
populations. As
with all research done within university populations, the results may
not be
relevant in a more diverse, representative population.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>Furthermore, research that investigates
anything to do with relationships in questionable when the sample
consists of
university students, because at university age the respondents have
relatively
little experience in romantic relationships and their use of and
ability to
detect deception, as well as the consequences to the relationship, may
be
subject to change as they mature and gain more experience.</span></p>

 lang="EN-CA">The research examined up until this point helps to
understand the types of deception used in romantic relationships, and
the use
of lying and how it relates to relational satisfaction, it brings up
the
question of how often deception is detected and how often it is
successful, and
also what other factors besides the stage in the development of the
relationship might be involved in the type and frequency of deception.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 36pt; line-height: 190%;"><span
 lang="EN-CA">Boon and McLeod (2001) investigated individuals&#8217;
perceptions of their deceptive ability and their attitudes toward
deception.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their investigation, four
questions were addressed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, they
looked at the extent to which romantic partners think they and their
partner
are successful at deceiving each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly,
they investigated whether or not individuals
have favourable
attitudes toward deception in romantic relationships, and if their
attitudes
depend on the context of deception.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Third,
the examined whether or not individual&#8217;s beliefs
about their own
and their partner&#8217;s ability to deceive successfully and their attitudes
about
deception in close relationships predicted the type of deception
strategies
they employ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, the researchers
investigated if an individual&#8217;s beliefs about their ability to deceive
and
their attitudes toward deception predicted their responses to suspected
deception.</span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 190%;"><span lang="EN-CA"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>To conduct the
study, 107 undergraduate students at an American university who were
currently
involved in a heterosexual relationship or had been in the past
completed a
questionnaire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The results showed that
people believe that they are successful when they deceive their
partners and
that they are better deceivers than their partners.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>They also found that attitudes about
deception are quite variable, but the majority of respondents had a
conditional
view of the acceptability of deception in romantic relationships.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Individuals who had a strong belief about the
importance of complete honesty in close relationships were less likely
to use
falsification, and were more likely to use jokes or sarcasm to deceive
their
partners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, their attitudes about
deception and their beliefs about their own or their partners&#8217; success
at
deception did not influence their use of omission, distortion or
non-verbal deception.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, the results
found that the strength
of the participant's belief that honesty is important was related to
the
likelihood that they would accuse their partner of lying and attempt to
confirm
their suspicions, and their attitudes about their own ability to lie
influenced
their reactions to their partner&#8217;s suspicions. </span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 190%;"><span lang="EN-CA"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>I think the results
of this study, while not overly surprising, are important for 2 reasons.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>First of all, the finding that people believe
themselves to be more successful at deceiving their partner than their
partner
is at deceiving them has been obtained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
contrast to other studies where this finding was
obtained, Boon and
McLeod offer some possible reasons why this is.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
provides some material for further research, and
indirectly
suggests a direction in which to move in terms of detection of
deception.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, this study
incorporated the
participant&#8217;s beliefs about the importance of honesty and their own
ability to
deceive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the authors didn&#8217;t
specifically comment on it, this also provides a direction for further
research.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This study found that the
individuals who have strong beliefs that honesty is important are less
likely
to use falsification, however, are their perceptions of their partner&#8217;s
use of
deception accurate or do they overestimate their partner&#8217;s honesty?</span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 190%;"><span lang="EN-CA"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Despite these
positive points regarding this study, there is, as always, the caution
that
university students may not be representative of the entire population
and so
research conducted within a university student sample cannot be
carelessly
generalized to the public.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also feel
that the study would have been more interesting if it had taken gender
as an
independent variable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gender role
stereotypes might influence the participant&#8217;s beliefs regarding the
value of
honesty, their beliefs concerning their own deception ability, and
their
perceived ability to detect deception.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

cues are
associated with deception, and differences in people&#8217;s beliefs about
their own
and other&#8217;s deception.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also discusses
what kinds of people are better at lying than others, what factors

 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>To summarise the
conclusions of the article, the face is essentially useless in
detection of
deception because it is very easy to control, however the body and
vocal cues
such as tone, pitch, speech rate, etc., are not as easily controllable
and are
therefore much more likely to leak cues of deception.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>Individuals who believe that lying is a
necessary evil and a part of life (high Machiavellian individuals) are
more
credible liars when motivated than individuals who think deception is
inexcusable (low Machiavellian individuals).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shorter,
prepared lies are less prone to detection than
long, elaborate
or spontaneous lies, although too much preparedness can negatively
affect
credibility and give the impression of being rehearsed.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>Women are considered to be superior to men in
the ability to associate changes in body movements and speech rate with
deception, and consistent with other research, most individuals
consider
themselves to be better at controlling their deceptive behaviour than
other
people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, men and women may
differ in terms of changes in body movements when lying.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>For example, women may increase leg and arm
movement, while men may decrease such movements when being deceptive.
Speaker
dominance also influences what changes occur in deception.</span></p>

future
research.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the title of the article
suggests that it is focussed on gender differences in detection of
deception,
the section that discusses gender differences in deception is
relatively small
and not very informative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, it
describes more the differences in cues of deception that differ between
men and
women (or even less specifically, low-dominant and high-dominant
speakers), but
does not really describe the differences in the ability to detect
deception
between the sexes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

considered:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>reciprocity, conflict
avoidance and intimacy needs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since

sharing, the researchers propose that individuals will behave

an
individual believes a valuable resource (information) is being
withheld, they
will reciprocate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also proposed
that deception might be motivated by a fear of partner disapproval; to
avoid
conflict, individuals might use deception.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally,
they proposed that individuals who fear intimacy
or abandonment
might deceive their partner to control intimacy either positively or
negatively.</span></p>

      </span>The study analyzed
the results of questionnaires completed by 128 heterosexual couples at
an
American university.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They found that
each of the three proposed motivations for deception were supported.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Perceptions of partner dishonesty were
correlated with lower levels of relational satisfaction and commitment,
and
deception was used as retaliation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
deception (by the participant) was related to
lower levels of
intimacy and closeness, and deception was found to be motivated by
avoidance of
punishment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Individuals who were more
uncomfortable with intimacy were found to be more likely to use
deception,
supporting the hypothesis that deception is used to control relational
intimacy, and individuals who feared abandonment were also found to be
more
likely to use deception. </span></p>

      </span>Cole&#8217;s study
offered evidence of two important notions: deception is often a sign of
relationship problems, and the best relational outcomes occur in
situations
when partners do not deceive each other and trust that each other are
honest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"

      </span>The advantage of
this research is that both partners in the couple were interviewed.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the results of each participant
could be compared with the results and beliefs of their partner, and
this way
the researchers were able to distinguish between the perceived
dishonesty and
actual dishonesty in each pair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Few
studies of deception are able to compare the actions of one partner to
the
reactions of the other in this way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Interesting
relationships were uncovered in this way, for
example, it
was once again found that generally, individuals assume that their
partner is
more honest than themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Unfortunately, due
to the restrictions of the recruitment process used (couples that had
been
dating at least 4 months), nothing was learned about the use of
deception and
the motivations behind it in the beginning stages of the relationship.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, since all the couples recruited were
currently in relationships, none of the sample involved couples who had
separated from each other as a result of deception. Another criticism
of the
study is that once again, the sample consisted of university students.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Similar research should be conducted in
varying settings, and include relationships in all stages, and people
with
varying levels of relational experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also,
it would be of interest to investigate the use of
deception in
other kinds of romantic relationships, such as homosexual relationships
or
those that take place over the internet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally,
research comparing the uses and motivations
behind deception in
long distance romantic relationships might be worth investigating.</span></p>

 lang="EN-CA">In terms Jang, Smith, &amp; Levine (2002) conducted a
study to investigate the relationship between attachment styles and
relational
outcomes following deception.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two
important questions were considered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First,
is the deceived partner&#8217;s communication pattern
following the
discovery of deception related to his or her attachment style?<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>And secondly, is the deceived partner&#8217;s
decision in terms of relation continuation or termination related to
their
attachment style?</span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 36pt; line-height: 190%;"><span
 lang="EN-CA">Based on the three types of infant attachment styles
proposed by Bowlby (1979, as cited in Jang, Smith &amp; Levine 2002),
the three
adult attachment styles considered in Jang, Smith &amp; Levine&#8217;s study
are
secure, anxious/ambivalent, and avoidant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Individuals
with a secure attachment style are trusting
and forgiving,
and tend to expect positive outcomes from relationships.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>Individuals with anxious/ambivalent
attachment styles, on the other hand, are highly aware of negative
affect
towards their relational partner, and tend to avoid discussing
upsetting issues
out of fear of jeopardizing the relationship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally,
individuals with avoidant attachment styles have
a tendency to
protect themselves by repressing negative affect and avoiding their
partners
when distressed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 36pt; line-height: 190%;"><span
 lang="EN-CA">The study analyzed the results of questionnaires
completed by 213 undergraduate university students.<span style="">&nbsp;

      </span>The researchers discovered that individuals
with a secure attachment style were more likely to talk to their
partner
directly about the deception.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By
discussing the event, they were unlikely to terminate the relationship
and
generally had positive relational outcomes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Individuals
who displayed an anxious/ambivalent attachment
style had a
tendency to avoid discussing the deception directly, but did continue
to
communicate with their partner about other things.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>Individuals with avoidant attachment styles
tended to avoid their partner altogether following the deception
incident, and
were also the most likely to terminate the relationship.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>However, other factors were found to
influence the decision to terminate the relationship.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>The best predictor of termination was found
to be the importance of the information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
avoiding the partner and not communicating was
also a
significant predictor of relationship termination. </span></p>

 lang="EN-CA">This study provides some interesting insights into the
consequences of deception in romantic relationships, and their results
could
prove to be helpful in counselling settings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of
course, further research is required to investigate the
findings in
larger populations, outside of the university community.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>The researchers do not overestimate the value
of their findings, however, and they themselves outline the following
three
limitations of the research.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, the
study focussed on the attachment and communication styles of the
partner who
was deceived, and therefore the influence of the other partner&#8217;s
communication
and attachment styles were not included in the investigation although
they are
likely to play an important role in relational outcomes.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>Secondly, the research was based on
retrospective accounts, and in light of the emotional subject matter of
the
study, the accounts can not be relied upon as being complete or
entirely
accurate in all cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thirdly, the study
was based on only one conceptualization of attachment styles, although
there
are others with somewhat different categories of attachments (Jang,
Smith &amp;
Levine, 2002). </span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 36pt; line-height: 190%;"><span
 lang="EN-CA">In my own opinion, I think the study would have
benefited if the researchers had also investigated the type of
deception
involved, and how the deception was discovered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
believe both these factors would influence the
relational outcomes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would also be
interesting to see if the
relational outcome differed depending on the length of the relationship
prior
to the deception, since commitment would likely be higher in more
established
relationships. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Finally, investigation of
the results in terms of gender might be a good starting point for
future
research.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Attachment styles and the
relational outcomes related to them might be partially dependent on the
gender
of the participants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

Haselton,
Buss, Oubaid, &amp; Angleitner (2005) conducted 3 studies to
investigate the
Strategic Interference Theory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
theory in based on evolutionary psychology, and suggests that certain
negative
emotions were evolved to defend people from deception and reduce its
consequences. The researchers investigated the differences between the
upset
caused by various deception situations in men and women.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>They found that, as they predicted, women
were more upset than men by deception involving exaggerated ambition,
exaggerated status, resource deception, pre-sex and post-sex commitment
deception, and exaggerated kindness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Men
on the other hand were found to be more upset than women when the
deception
involved sexual access, exaggerated sexual desirability and concealed
sexual
infidelity, and concealed sexual fantasies involving other men.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no significant difference between
men and women&#8217;s upset when the deception involved concealed emotional
infidelity, age deception, hiding emotions, exaggerated sexual
enjoyment or
concealed previous involvement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both
sexes rated concealed sexual infidelity among the most distressing
forms of
deception.</span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 190%;"><span lang="EN-CA"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>The results of the
study are intriguing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The differences in
upset between the sexes in relation to the various forms of deception
provide
strong support for the strategic interference theory.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>As predicted, women are more upset than men
when the deception involves resources, commitment, since these are
important to
women&#8217;s sexual and reproductive success in evolutionary terms (women
desire
long term commitment and resources from men to aid in child rearing).<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Men are upset more than women by deception
involving real or imagined sexual infidelity, which is theoretically
important
to men&#8217;s sexual and reproductive success in evolutionary terms (men are
uncertain about paternity of their children and fear sexual infidelity).<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Many of the other studies involving deception
in romantic relationships ignore differences between the sexes in their
reactions to deception, and the beauty of this study is that it not
only
recognizes that differences exist, but it defines where the differences
lie,
provides a theoretical perspective to organize and understand the
differences
and also finds situations where there is not too much difference
between the
genders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Research should follow to
expand on the findings, determine if the results are found in varying
cultures
and age groups, and if the differences exist even in established long
term
relationships.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am curious whether or
not the results are actually the result of evolutionary adaptations, or
if
gender role stereotypes might be involved in the differences found.
Research
attempting to distinguish the actual source of the differences would be
of
interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

      </span>Deception in
romantic relationships is a common occurrence, and the dissolution of
many
relationships is the direct result of some type of deception.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The types of deception common in romantic
relationships vary based on the influence of many factors, as does the
motivation for the deception, the manner of detection, and the
relational
outcomes. There is no simple paradigm for deception in close
relationships, in
each case it is different and the consequences cannot be accurately
predicted,
though they are often severe and life altering.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

      </span>However, it is
clear that people continue to engage in deception, even knowing the
potential
consequences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Humans are imperfect, and
everyone lies to some degree in certain situations.<span style="">&nbsp;

      </span>Deception is an unavoidable part of social
interaction, and a great amount of energy is invested in discovering
the
truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is evident not only in the
amount of time individuals personally invest in trying to detect
deception, but
in other aspects of life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Police and
other intelligence agencies have developed a wide range of technologies
designed to detect dishonesty, and what are criminal court trials if
not
impressive attempts to discover who is being honest?<span style="">&nbsp;

      </span>Obviously, there is
a great deal left to be learned about deception, particularly within
the
context of romantic relationships.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
topic should continue to be researched in psychology because of its
importance
in our daily lives and the power it has to provoke great changes in

<p style="margin-left: 270px;">How not to drown while surfing</p>

<br>
<p>First, respect that the ocean is stronger than you are. The force of even an average swell is far greater than anyone can resist.That's why it carries you along. But when those get to a certain point, they'll carry you down.</p>
<p>Don't go surfing when the conditions are greater than you can handle. Don't push the limits until you're very experienced.</p>

<p>Next, be aware of the ever changing patterns in the water. Riptides can appear seemingly out of nowhere. Sometimes they're just an inconvenience, dragging you down the beach away from the spot on shore you want to reach.</p>

<p>But, those surface currents can also drag you out to sea, especially if you're fatigued.Stay strong and get out of a rip current as soon as you sense it.</p>

<p>They're not difficult to spot if you're alert. They appear as calm flows, usually as a strip or channel within surrounding turbulent water.The color will often appear slightly different. They don't drag you under, but they can put you far enough out that you can't return to shore. </p>

<p>Then you tire before reaching safety and go under. Swim or paddle parallel to the shore until you're out of it, then return to shore if you're tired.Undertow is similar, but in this case the water flow is under the surface.</p>

<p>When you're on your board that's not usually a problem.But if you fall, you'll often go far enough to reach it, and it can drag you down further and away from the shore.</p>

<p>Again, try to swim parallel, at the same time rising to reach the surface.Swimming directly up makes it harder to reach the surface.</p>

<p>One of the more likely problems that can lead to drowning while surfing is being hit with your board.</p>

<p>Even the most advanced surfers fall of their surfboards at some time.</p>

<p>It's difficult, but necessary, to be alert when you're on the way into the water.Try to note which way your board is moving. When you return to the surface, don't assume your board has floated away.</p>

<p>The board is almost as likely to move back toward you as away from you.That's convenient, but dangerous.</p>

<p>If you use an ankle leash your surfboard can't move far away.That means you can be the cause of it hitting you if you don't move the right way.</p>

<p>Practice in a swimming pool to get used to manipulating your leg and the board to grab the board before it hits you in the head.</p>

<p>Being knocked unconscious by a surfboard is easy and, as you're often reminded, you can drown in a foot of water.Develop into a strong swimmer, watch the ocean and stay alert.Your odds of drowning will be very low.</p>

<p>Also, make sure you have the right sun protection swimwear gear, to be protected again the sun UV radiation and its damaging effect on your skin.</p><br>


<p style="margin-left: 270px;">Simple Truths We Often Forget</p>
<br>

<p>Sometimes we find ourselves running in place, struggling to get ahead simply because we forget to address some of the simple truths that govern our potential to make progress.  So here's a quick reminder:</p>

<p>    The acquisition of knowledge doesn't mean you're growing.  Growing happens when what you know changes how you live.</p>
<p>    You can't have good ideas unless you're willing to generate a lot of bad ones.</p>
<p>    A good idea without action is worth nothing.</p>
<p>    Change is often resisted when it is needed the most.</p>
<p>    Discipline is choosing what you want most over what you want right now.  Read The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.</p>
<p>    People seldom do things to the best of their ability.  They do things to the best of their willingness.</p>
<p>    You can't change other people; you can only offer guidance, and lead by example.</p>
<p>    Right now, there's a lot you don't know.  And if you never challenge your own beliefs, the list will never shrink.</p>
<p>    If you're talking to someone you don't know well, you may be talking to someone who knows way more about the topic of conversation than you do.</p>
<p>    The most common and harmful addiction in the world is the draw of comfort.</p>
<p>    Growth begins at the end of your comfort zone.  Stepping outside of your comfort zone will put things into perspective from an angle you can't grasp now.</p>
<p>    When you spend time worrying, you're simply using your imagination to create things you don't want.</p>
<p>    It's usually only as good or bad as you think it is.  Most of what we see is only what we think about what we see.</p>
<p>    Most of the bad things you worry about will never happen.  Most of the bad things that do happen will have never crossed your worried mind.</p>
<p>    Some circumstances are uncontrollable, but we can always decide how we react to those circumstances.</p>
<p>    Those who complain the most, accomplish the least.</p>
<p>    Whenever somebody discredits you, and tells you that you can't do something, keep in mind that they are speaking from within the boundaries of their own limitations.</p>
<p>    Every problem you have in your life right now is your responsibility, regardless of who initially caused it.</p>
<p>    It's not so much about finding opportunities as it is about creating them.</p>
<p>    Having a plan, even a flawed one at first, is better than no plan at all.</p>
<p>    Paving your own road is intelligent only if nobody has gone exactly where you are going.</p>
<p>    What you do every day matters more than what you do every once in a while.</p>
<p>    What you don't start today won't be finished by tomorrow.</p>
<p>    If you're waiting for the perfect conditions, ideas or plans to get started, you'll never achieve anything.</p>
<p>    Doing something and getting it wrong is at least ten times more productive than doing nothing.</p>
<p>    Putting something off makes it instantly harder and scarier.</p>
<p>    You cannot change what you refuse to confront.</p>
<p>    If you keep doing what you're doing, you'll keep getting what you're getting.</p>
<p>    The harder you work, the luckier you will become.</p>
<p>    Kindness and hard work together will always carry you farther than intelligence.</p>
<p>    Lots of successful people have failed as many times as they have succeeded.</p>
<p>    Failures are simply lessons that help you prepare for next time.</p>
<p>    Being successful is a journey, not a destination.</p>
<p>    To be successful does not mean you have to dominate others; it means you have to dominate your own potential.</p>
<p>    Your success isn't just about you.  It's about how you positively impact the lives around you.</p>
<p>    Being busy and being productive are two different things.</p>
<p>    Being happy and being successful are two different things.</p>
<p>    You have every right to be happy, but it's up to YOU and only YOU to exercise that right.  Read Stumbling on Happiness.</p>
<p>    Everyone you meet is better than you at something.  We all have different strengths.  What worked for someone else might not work for you.</p>
<p>    When you're worried about what others think of you, you're really just worried about what you think of yourself.</p>
<p>    The bad news: nothing is permanent.  The good news: nothing is permanent.</p>
<p>    You don't have to settle.  It's simply a choice you make every day.  If you don't like your life, then it's time to start making changes and better choices.</p>
<p>    There's no such thing as 'risk free.'  Everything you do or don't do has an inherent risk.</p>
<p>    No matter how smart you are, you will make mistakes.</p>
<p>    Problems, when they arise, are rarely as painful and hurtful as the process of fearing them.</p>
<p>    Confusion isn't a bad thing.  It means you're growing and thinking.</p>
<p>    Just because you can doesn't mean you should.</p>
<p>    In the beginning, you need to say "yes" to a lot of things to discover and establish your goals.  Later on, you need to say "no" to a lot of things and concentrate on your goals.</p>
<p>    Even if it doesn't cost any money, it's not free if it takes up your time.</p>
<p>    No matter how you make a living or who you think you work for, you only work for one person, yourself.  The big question is:  What are you selling, and to whom?</p>
<p>    Money makes life easier only when it's yours free and clear.  The stress of financial debt can change a person.</p>
<p>    The fewer possessions you own, the more you will use and enjoy them.</p>
<p>    Life is not easy, especially when you plan on achieving something worthwhile.</p>
<p>    There is good reason why you should wake each morning and mindfully consider what and who you will give your day to:  Because unlike other things in life - love, money, respect, good health, hope, opportunities, and many more - time is the one thing you can never get back once it's gone.</p>
<p>    Cutting your losses is often better than the alternative.</p>
<p>    We sometimes do things that are permanently foolish just because we are temporarily upset.</p>
<p>    Screaming at people always makes things worse.</p>
<p>    Everyone likes a person who gets straight to the point.</p>
<p>    First impressions are oftentimes inaccurate judgments of a person's true character.</p>
<p>    When you're up, your friends know who you are.  When you're down, you know who your friends are.</p>
<p>    If someone wants you in their life, they'll make room for you.  You shouldn't have to fight for a spot.</p>
<p>    When someone truly loves you, they don't ever have to say a word.  You will be able to tell simply by the way they treat you over the long-term.</p>
<p>    We rarely lose friends, we usually just figure out who our real ones are.</p>
<p>    Just because one person doesn't seem to care for you, doesn't mean you should forget about everyone else who does.</p>
<p>    Family isn't always blood.  They're the people in your life who want you in theirs - the ones who would do anything to see you smile and who love you no matter what.</p>
<p>    Good looks attracts the eyes.  Personality attracts the heart.</p>
<p>    In human relationships, distance is not measured in miles but in affection.  Two people can be right next to each other, yet miles apart.</p>
<p>    Being nice to someone you dislike doesn't mean you're fake.  It means you're mature enough to control your emotions.</p>
<p>    If you aren't happy being single, you won't be happy in a relationship.  You have to create your own life first before you can share it with someone else.</p>
<p>    Whenever you hate someone or something, you are giving that person or thing a piece of your heart.  Read The Road Less Traveled.</p>
<p>    Life is too short to spend time with people who suck the happiness out of you.</p>
<p>    It's better to be alone than to be in bad company.</p>
<p>    Saying "no" to right people gives you the time and resources required to say "yes" to right opportunities.</p>
<p>    When you stop chasing the wrong things you give the right things a chance to catch you.</p>
<p>    You can raise the bar or you can wait for others to raise it.  Either way, it's getting raised.</p>
<p>    In life you get what you put in.  If you want love, give love.  If you want friends, be friendly.  If you want money, provide value.  It really is this simple.</p>
<p>    Cynicism might seem warranted at times, but it's never useful.</p>
<p>    Everyone dies, some sooner than later, and often unexpectedly.  To know this means you are alive, with a chance to make the time you have left count.</p>
<p>    You are in competition with one person and one person only - yourself.  You are competing to be the best you can be.</p>
<p>    Trying to be somebody you're not is a sure path to self-hate, and a waste of the person you are.</p>
<p>    It's better to be disliked for who you are than to be liked for who you are not.</p>
<p>    Giving up doesn't always mean you're weak, sometimes it means you are strong enough and smart enough to let go.</p>
<p>    Sometimes you need to distance yourself to see things clearly.</p>
<p>    You can't make the same exact mistake twice. The second time you make it, it's no longer a mistake, it's a choice.</p>
<p>    Not getting what you want is sometimes a wonderful stroke of luck.</p>
<p>    You never have to deal with more than one moment at a time.</p>
<p>    Many of the greatest lessons we learn in life we don't seek on purpose.</p>
<p>    You have to fight through some bad days to earn the best days of your life.</p>
<p>    A harsh fact of life:  Bad things do happen to good people.</p>
<p>    Regardless of the situation, the sun rises the next day and life goes on.</p>
<p>    You never know how strong you really are until being strong is the only choice you have.</p>
<p>    We end up regretting the things you did NOT do far more than the things you did.</p>
<p>    We meet no ordinary people in our lives.  If you give them a chance, everyone has something amazing to offer.</p>
<p>    Every passing face on the street represents a story every bit as compelling and complicated as yours.</p>
<p>    People are not as beautiful as they look, as they walk, or as they talk.  They are only as beautiful as they love, as they care, and as they share.</p>
<p>    Silence is often the loudest cry.  So pay attention to those you care about.</p>
<p>    Making one person smile can change the world.  Maybe not the whole world, but their world.</p>
<p>    Blowing out another's candle will not make yours shine brighter.</p>
<p>    No matter how many mistakes you make or how slow you progress, you are still way ahead of everyone who isn't trying.</p>
<p>    Things turn out best for people who make the best out of the way things turn out.</p>
<p>    Life is short.  If there was ever a moment to follow your passion and do something that matters to you, that moment is now.</p> <br>
