How To Be Happy Living Alone - 15 Things To Do When You Are Alone


Leave me alone I don't want to be alone”, he is mean, he deserves to be alone these are some of the comments you must have came across in your life. 
Noticeable thing about these comment is that they signify negative emotions. Staying alone or keeping someone alone is considered to be character flaw in our society.


<p>If you notice carefully you will witness that this loneliness we are referring here is just temporary and it will go away soon because a person who is alone now will get some companion soon. The world is full of loving friends. Out of these some are looking for a friend and some want to be friends with other people.</p>

<p>But the <strong>effect created by the temporary loneliness is much more exaggerated and people become victim of this loneliness. They either switch to drinks, drugs, smoking and few unbelievable people commit the crime of suicide. The best thing to do in loneliness is to think, to think about the correcting the mistakes, to think about new opportunities but unfortunately very few are capable of this.</p>

<p>Groups, society, mob, crowd all these versions of collection of people are just an illusion, an illusion persisting for long time. The fact is you are alone for yourself right from your first breath on the earth to your last breath, arent you?. If you look closely not only birth and death but most of the time you live alone even in presence of others.</p> 


<p> For example, you stay with your parents but how many of their habits you do not like?. You get happy only when things goes according to your likes and dislikes, you even do not care what others may feel, you follow only your opinions, beliefs, choices absolutely alone. This is what people refer as selfishness.</p>

<p>Do not think of loneliness as ‘you are alone’; think of it as you are a self. You with your thoughts, your reasoning, your experiences, your memories, your creativity and there is no one to disturb you, to interfere with you, to rule you. Being alone is like you are free, and freedom is the highest and prime right of every individual.</p><p>Ask a writer, a painter, a magician, a scientist which is their favorite place to work?. I am sure they will answer a place where I can be alone. I request all the lonely people to trace the history and you will be pleasantly surprised to know that the revolutions, inventions, great artistic works, change has been brought by an individual or a lonely person to be specific. You wish to be alone with your girlfriend or wife, then what is the harm if you stay alone with yourself for some time.</p>

<p>An individual or lonely person can <strong>hardly create the threat for the world</strong>; it is a group which threatens the world with acts like war, anarchy, racism. A lonely person brings change, hope happiness for the suffering world. So do not worry about your loneliness it will go away soon. I will suggest take out few minutes from 24 hours every day for you alone and introspect you might find you are next Einstein or Shakespeare.</p>
