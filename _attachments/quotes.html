<p>Gambler Jake Green enters into a game with potentially deadly consequences.</p>
<p>Director: Guy Ritchie</p>
<p>Writers: Luc Besson (adaptation), Guy Ritchie</p>
<br>

            <p> One thing I've learned in the last seven years,</p>

            <p>in every game and con there is always</p>
            an opponent and there is always a victim.

            <p>The trick is to know when you're the latter,
            so you can become the former.</p>

            <p>How deep did you bury that shareholder, Paul?</p>

            <p>Deep.</p>

            <p>Are you sure this is a good idea?</p>

            <p>He has to pay us something, doesn't he?</p>

            <p>But you've got more money
            than you could ever spend.</p>

            <p>That's all you think about nowadays.</p>

            <p>He owes me and he owes you.</p>

            <p>Now he has to pay.</p>

            <p>It's cause and effect.</p>

            <p>20.</p>

            <p>Hold on.</p>

            <p>I think we'll take the stairs, eh, Billy?</p>

            <p>You want to walk 20 flights, Jake?</p>

            <p>Don't be silly.</p>

            <p>I don't like to feel trapped. Never did, never will.Why should a man do what he doesn't like to do?</p>

            <p>Jake, if you want to take the stairs, we'll take the stairs...</p>

            <p>There's always a choice.</p>

            <p>What's wrong with the stairs?</p>

            <p>Come on, you'll be all right.</p>

            <p>I've got to spend the next two minutes shaking and sweating like a crack whore clucking for a fix. Should have taken the stairs, cos it's getting very, very tight in here.</p>

            <p>Have a seat, Mr. Green.</p>

            <p>I hear you've done very well for yourself and against all the odds.</p>

            <p>They do say, the harder the battle the sweeter the victory.</p>

            <p>A wise man once told me there's only one rule in this world,a small question that drives all success. The more a man invests in that question, the more powerful that man will become. Can you guess what that question is, Mr. Green? What's in it for me? I've been warned if I let you sit down at this table I might regret it. They say you've become very ambitious in your maturing, and you now wish to acquire yourself a business, a business like my business? But we both know what you are, don't we, Jake? You're a man who needs a master. You're an employee. So, what's in it for me? The pleasure of doing an old employee a favor, by reminding him of the position nature chose for him.</p>

            <p>Very impressive, Mr. Green. You've honed those talents most skillfully.</p>

            <p>Pay the man his money, Billy.</p>

            <p>Should have bet the whole lot, Rade. You have to teach me that trick sometime.</p>

            <p>You're on. I'll toss you for everything under your chin. There isn't a problem is there, Mr. D?</p>

            <p>You've got a big mouth on a small head,sunshine.</p>

            <p>Be my guest. I'll take purple.</p>

            <p>You're on.</p>

            <p>It's a lovely color, purple,discretely sandwiched within the color spectrum between blue and white.Always a royal winner.</p>

            <p>illy, do the honors.</p>

            <p>Don't you fucking move.Don't let your mouth put you in more trouble than your body could handle.</p>

            <p>I'll tell you what I'll do.I'll exercise a bit of charity.</p>

            <p>Double or quits?</p>

            <p>You're on.</p>

            <p>Come on.</p>

            <p>Mr. Green, Mr. Macha would appreciate it if you came back to the table.</p>

            <p>I haven't finished with him yet.</p>

            <p>Now would be a good time.</p>

            <p>I think it's time to fly, don't you, Jake?</p>

            <p>- Excuse me.</p>
            <p>- We're coming through here.</p>

            <p>Relax. You're in trouble, Mr. Green. We could help.</p>

            <p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>I take the stairs.</p>

            <p>I had him in my sights... three times.</p>

            <p>You never miss, let alone three times.</p>

            <p>Somebody told him we was coming.Something is very wrong here.</p>

            <p>Yeah, something's fucking wrong all right.</p>

            <p>Don't make me angry, Slim.I might have missed him,but I ain't going to miss you, not at this range.Maybe it's better you just drive.</p>

            <p>Doreen, Mr. Green. Mr. Green, Doreen.</p>

            <p>Avi, Mr. Green. Mr. Green, Avi.</p>

            <p>Sit down.I gather you're quite the player? I'm a bit of an enthusiast myself. I thought maybe we could have a few games.</p>

            <p>I think you should tell me what is going on, don't you?</p>

            <p>We have your medical results from the hospital.It's not important how we got them. What is important, however, is what it has to say. You will die within three days from a very unpleasant ailment that contaminates your blood and organs.</p>

            <p>Thanks, fellas. I'll get back to you on this one, yeah?</p>

            <p>Mr. Green. 30 seconds, and you can be on your way.</p>

            <p>The longer you listen, the sweeter the pitch.</p>

            <p>30 seconds?</p>

            <p>We've already saved your life once. The next time will not be for free.</p>

            <p>We shall assist you under two conditions. These conditions are not negotiable.</p>

            <p>Oh, I'm being grafted.</p>

            <p>Condition one. We will bleed you dry.</p>

            <p>You have to put on a better shirt before you bleed me dry, my friend.</p>

            <p>You will give us every penny you have got.</p>

            <p>This is a con.</p>

            <p>It's only natural that you think that you are somehow being conned, but think a little harder, and you will realize that this is not a trick.</p>

            <p>Now, condition two. You will do as we tell you without argument.This includes answering any questions that are asked.</p>

            <p>You don't have a lot of time, and, in reality, you don't have a choice.</p>

            <p>Now, the most sensible thing to do would be to get a second opinion. Macha has unleashed his legions. We can protect you from the dangers you face. That is our deal. You have three hours to decide. After that, you will be beyond our help.</p>

            <p>Think I'm going to part withmy hard-earned cash for a set of home-made hospital results? I don't think so. Not today.</p>

            <p>I don't have good news, I'm afraid, Mr. Green.</p>

            <p>They've thought this one through all right. Oh, they're smart. Smart as a pair of a little boy's shoes.</p>

            <p>She has to be in on it.That's how they got the results.</p>

            <p>Got to find someone they couldn't have got to.</p>

            <p>Well, Jake...</p>

            <p>When you're winning, who thinks about losing? But when you're faced with what I'm looking at, a new and cold reality dawns. A fact we like to ignore.You can not win. The only prize they guarantee when you play this game is that you will lose. It's only a question of when.</p>

            <p>If there is one thing I have learnt about experts, they're experts on fuck all. If there's a rule, you can bend it. If there's a law, it can be broken. From now on, I am breaking all the rules, because desperate men do desperate deeds.</p>

            <p>Cash just seems to remain king, doesn't it? New bills. Not too many of them in this town. I love a new bill. Represents so much hope. Look how clean and stiff it is. It even smells proud. 
            <p>Your work starts now. You'll be driving.</p>

            <p>We are, and I apologize for the unnecessarily dramatic moniker, loan sharks. People hate and fear us, just like you will learn to hate and fear us. We know how much you love a dollar bill, and it won't be easy watching them
            fall through your hands, because it will be your money that we will be loaning.</p>

            <p>Don't say a word. Just hold the bag and if we nod, leave it on the table.</p>

            <p>There's nothing left.</p>

            <p>That's a very sad story, Mr. Horowitz. My sympathies are with you and your colleague.</p>

            <p>Excuse us for having to know the reason for your loan, but we have to assess our clients very carefully.</p>

            <p>If you snap those fingers at me again, I'll fucking break 'em.</p>

            <p>We need to know how much time you did, and who you did it with.</p>

            <p>Why?</p>

            <p>"Why?" The deal is we ask the questions.</p>

            <p>I had two choices inside, 14 years' normal time or seven years' solitary. I chose the solitary. I spent 20 hours a day locked up in between two salty convicts who had been down there for more years than they cared to remember. One was a chess master, the other a master conman. They had never seen or spoken to each other, but they might as well have been married, they knew so much about one another. Once a day, the library on wheels
            would be pushed around by a pair of axe-murdering twins, that had pushed the trolley for 22 years. My neighbors used to write down chess moves and concepts of the con in the back pages of books based on subjects like...
            Theoretical Astrophysics Part Four, The Mathematics Of Quantum Mechanics. They just used them for the con. I used to intercept the books, because I was sandwiched in between their cells. It's a dangerous combination, chess and cons. These boys were locked up on their own for ten years with no distractions. Nothing to do but think about how to steal one another's pieces. Yeah, they thought. They really thought. I was under the impression that I was
            the clever bastard before I went in. But these boys were a completely different class. Head tricksters of the premier division. Their sole ambition was to create the ultimate con and win the ultimate game,always thinking quicker, always thinking bigger. Gradually, they thought they'd found a formula to the con. Check. A formula to win the ultimate win, the formula. I couldn't understand the depth of it, but they were confident it was real
            and I believed them. After all, they'd been right on everything else, so now they felt they'd had their moment and it was time for them to leave the confines of their cell. The concrete and steel wasn't even mentioned. I didn't even doubt them. They got whatever they wanted anyway. I could smell their food through 12 inches of concrete. Bastards knew it used to drive me mad. 
            We were all going to go together, they swore to me. "You're coming with us, Jake." And I trusted them. Never for a second did I doubt them. Next day, they were gone without a trace. For the next week,
            the authorities tore the place apart. Couldn't find evidence of their existence,
            let alone their exit. They just evaporated. Check.

            Two years later, I was out.

            But those two knew everything about me.

            Everything. All my dirty little secrets,
            how much money I had, where I kept it.

            The hustling bastards cleaned me out.

            They didn't leave so much
            as a pair of socks, only a note.

            Rule one: You can only get smarter
            by playing a smarter opponent.

            But I had their formula and

            it worked.

            It really worked.</p>

            Not doing you much good now, is it?

            <p>Checkmate.</p>

            <p>He needs to get moving. Give him the addresses.</p>

            <p>Why are they dragging this on? They could just clean me out in one hit. They want me to suffer. These twisted bastards are making me pay. Pay for my own pain.
            Hands down, that's the most radical concept
            I have ever heard of and a part of me dies every time I think about it.

            I told myself if this is my last round,
            they'll have to tear me out, piece by piece,

            but this I can't take.

            They've found a weakness.

            Caught me fair and square, cross-haired,

            blind-folded, one foot in the grave
            and two hands on the coffin.

            I'm cooked, well done,
            stick a fork in me and see if I bleed.</p>

            <p>I am stuck in a trance somewhere between hell and a hard place in a gear that doesn't exist,

            and all I want now is a little peace.</p>

            <p>Mr. Green, you took your time.</p>

            <p>- Did you get anything from the old lady?</p>
            <p>- No.</p>

            <p>Did you get anything from Horowitz?</p>

            <p>- No.</p>
            <p>- Why not?</p>

            <p>Because he didn't have it.</p>

            <p>Listen, pal, either he pays or you pay.</p>

            <p>I pay anyway.</p>

            <p>Don't be a smartass.</p>

            <p>Look, man,
            we are not sending you out to polish door knobs.

            You've got to get with it, man.

            Doreen, take his car.

            Come with us.</p>



       <h3>     <p style="margin-left: 200px;">A Christmass Carol</p> </h3>

<p>An animated retelling of Charles Dickens' classic novel about a Victorian-era miser taken on a journey of self-redemption, courtesy of several mysterious Christmas apparitions.</p>

<p>Writers: Robert Zemeckis (screenplay), Charles Dickens (novel)</p>
<br>

            <p>Tuppence is tuppence.</p>
            <p>What reason have you to be merry?  You're poor enough.</p> 
            <p>What right have you to be so dismal?  You're rich enough.</p>
            <p>- Humbug! </p>
            <p>- Don't be cross, Uncle. </p>
            <p>What else can I be when I live </p>
            <p>in such a world of fools as this?  What's Christmastime to you but  a time for paying bills without money. </p> 
            <p>A time for finding yourself a year older and not a penny richer. </p>
            <p>If I could work my will,every idiot who goes about with ''Merry Christmas'' on his lips should be boiled in his own pudding and buried with a stake of holly through his heart!</p>
            <p>Keep Christmas in your own way  and let me keep it in mine.</p>
            <p>Keep it? But you don't keep it!</p>
            <p>Let me leave it alone then.</p>
            <p>Let me hear another sound out of you, Cratchit, and you'll keep Christmas  by losing your situation!</p>
            <p>You're quite a powerful speaker, sir.  A wonder you don't go into Parliament.</p>
            <p>Are there no prisons?</p>
            <p>Prisons? Yes, yes, plenty of prisons.</p>
            <p>And the union workhouses,  are they still in operation? </p>
            <p>They are. I wish I could say they were not. The treadmill in full vigor?</p>
            <p>- Good!  I was afraid something had occurred  to stop them in their useful course.</p>
            <p>What shall we put you down for?</p>
            <p>- Nothing. </p>
            <p>- Oh, you wish to remain anonymous?</p>
            <p>I wish to be left alone!  I don't make merry myself at Christmas,</p>
            <p>You'll want all day tomorrow, I suppose?</p>
            <p>Well, if quite convenient, sir.</p>
            <p>It's not convenient, and it's not fair.</p>
            <p>- Who are you? </p>
            <p>- Ask me who I was.</p>
            <p>Who were you then?</p>
            <p>In life, I was your partner, Jacob Marley.</p>
            <p>Can you sit down?</p>
            <p>- I can. </p>
            <p>- Do it then.</p>
            <p>You do not believe in me.</p>
            <p>I don't.</p>
            <p>Why do you doubt your senses?</p>
            <p>Because the littlest thing  can affect them.</p>
            <p>A slight disorder of the stomach  can make them cheat.</p>
            <p>You may be an undigested bit of beef.  A blot of mustard.A crumb of cheese.  A fragment of underdone potato. There's more of gravy than of grave  about you, whatever you are. </p>
            <p>Mercy! Dreadful apparition,  why do you trouble me?</p>
            <p>Man of worldly mind,  do you believe in me or not?</p>
            <p>I do! I must!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Good heavens.I was bred in this place. I was a boy here.</p>
            <p>Your lip... is trembling.</p>
            <p>And what's that?</p>
            <p>- On your cheek? </p>
            <p>- Nothing. Something in my eye. </p>
            <p>Do you remember the way?</p>
            <p>Remember it? I could walk it blindfolded.</p>
            <p> These are but shadows of things that have been.  They have no consciousness... of us.</p>
            <p>I knew them. I know every one of them. They were schoolmates of mine.</p>
            <p>Let's go on. This... This was my school. </p>
            <p>This school is not quite deserted. A solitary child neglected by his friends is Left here still.</p> 
            <p> you fear the world too much </p>
            <p> you've changed. </p>
            <p>You mean to say you took them down while he was lying there</p>
            <p>somebody was fool enough to put it on him, to be buried in, but I took it, of him</p>
            <p>he frightened everyone away while he was alive</p>
            <p>only to profit us</p>
            <p>did you do all this things?</p>
            <p>A full 16 minutes Late. </p>
            <p>What do you mean by coming here at this time of day? </p>
            <p>I'm very sorry, sir.  I am a bit behind in my time. </p>
            <p>You are, indeed. Step in here. </p>
            <p>Well, it's only once a year, sir. It shall not be repeated.</p> 
            <p>I was making rather merry yesterday. </p>
            <p>Now, I'II tell you what, Mr. Cratchit. I'm not going to stand for this sort of thing any Longer. And therefore... And therefore...</p>

            <p>..it's just that sometimes when I speak so forcefully, people just crack, instantly.</p>

            <p>Now, let me, reconstruct the crime.</p>

            <p>You came into the room when?</p>

            <p>And what was the first thing you did?</p>

            <p>The moon that night was so beautiful. It made me close to the Lord</p>

            <p>i'm picking up on something. You're very spiritual man , aren't you?</p>

            <p>It's part of my job, to read people. I think i'm quite good, at it too.</p>

            <p>Ahh, you know if you organized your closets by color, it would save you time, in your rush to get to work in the morning </p>

            <p>it's what I do , and it saves me time.</p>

            <p>Now, in order, to better visualize the crime, i'm going to place myself, in your position</p>

            <p>I walk out on to the balcony</p>

            <p>I am now out on the balcony</p>

            <p>now, you see why it's important to re-create the events</p>

            <p>or perhaps, the thief was hiding in a ledge or recess</p>
