<p><b>How Not To Drown While Surfing</b></p>

<p></p><p></p><br>
<p>First, respect that the ocean is stronger than you are. The force of even an average swell is far greater than anyone can resist.</p>

<p>That's why it carries you along. But when those get to a certain point, they'll carry you down.</p>

<p>Don't go surfing when the conditions are greater than you can handle. Don't push the limits until you're very experienced.</p>

<p>Next, be aware of the ever changing patterns in the water. Riptides can appear seemingly out of nowhere.</p>

<p>Sometimes they're just an inconvenience, dragging you down the beach away from the spot on shore you want to reach.</p>

<p>But, those surface currents can also drag you out to sea, especially if you're fatigued.</p>

<p>Stay strong and get out of a rip current as soon as you sense it.</p>

<p>They're not difficult to spot if you're alert. They appear as calm flows, usually as a strip or channel within surrounding turbulent water. </p>

<p>The color will often appear slightly different. They don't drag you under, but they can put you far enough out that you can't return to shore. </p>

<p>Then you tire before reaching safety and go under. Swim or paddle parallel to the shore until you're out of it, then return to shore if you're tired. </p>

<p>Undertow is similar, but in this case the water flow is under the surface.</p>

<p>When you're on your board that's not usually a problem.</p>

<p>But if you fall, you'll often go far enough to reach it, and it can drag you down further and away from the shore.</p>

<p>Again, try to swim parallel, at the same time rising to reach the surface.</p>

<p>Swimming directly up makes it harder to reach the surface.</p>

<p>One of the more likely problems that can lead to drowning while surfing is being hit with your board.</p>

<p>Even the most advanced surfers fall of their surfboards at some time.</p>

<p>It's difficult, but necessary, to be alert when you're on the way into the water.</p>

<p>Try to note which way your board is moving. When you return to the surface, don't assume your board has floated away.</p>

<p>The board is almost as likely to move back toward you as away from you.</p>

<p>That's convenient, but dangerous.</p>

<p>If you use an ankle leash your surfboard can't move far away.</p>

<p>That means you can be the cause of it hitting you if you don't move the right way.</p>

<p>Practice in a swimming pool to get used to manipulating your leg and the board to grab the board before it hits you in the head.</p>

<p>Being knocked unconscious by a surfboard is easy and, as you're often reminded, you can drown in a foot of water.</p>

<p>Develop into a strong swimmer, watch the ocean and stay alert.</p>

<p>Your odds of drowning will be very low.</p>
<p>Also, make sure you have the right sun protection swimwear gear, to be protected again the sun UV radiation and its damaging effect on your skin.</p>
