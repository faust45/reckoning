<h1 style="margin-left: 40px;" class="western"><font style="font-size: 13pt;" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How Not To Drown While Surfing</font><br>
</h1>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">	First, respect that the ocean is stronger than you are. The force
of even an average swell is far greater than anyone can resist. <br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">That's why it carries you along. But when those get to a certain
point, they'll carry you down. <br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Don't go surfing when the conditions
are greater than you can handle. Don't push the limits until you're
very experienced.<br><br>Next, be aware of the ever changing patterns
in the water. Riptides can appear seemingly out of nowhere.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> Sometimes
they're just an inconvenience, dragging you down the beach away from
the spot on shore you want to reach. <br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">But, those surface currents can
also drag you out to sea, especially if you're fatigued. <br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Stay strong
and get out of a rip current as soon as you sense it.<br><br>They're
not difficult to spot if you're alert. They appear as calm flows,
usually as a strip or channel within surrounding turbulent water. <br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The
color will often appear slightly different. They don't drag you
under, but they can put you far enough out that you can't return to
shore. <br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Then you tire before reaching safety and go under. Swim or
paddle parallel to the shore until you're out of it, then return to
shore if you're tired. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Undertow is similar, but in this case the water flow is under the
surface. <br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">When you're on your board that's not usually a problem. <br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">But
if you fall, you'll often go far enough to reach it, and it can drag
you down further and away from the shore. <br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Again, try to swim
parallel, at the same time rising to reach the surface. <br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Swimming
directly up makes it harder to reach the surface.<br><br>One of the
more likely problems that can lead to drowning while surfing is being
hit with your board.<br><br>Even the most advanced surfers fall of
their surfboards at some time.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> It's difficult, but necessary, to be
alert when you're on the way into the water.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> Try to note which way
your board is moving. When you return to the surface, don't assume
your board has floated away. <br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The board is almost as likely to move
back toward you as away from you. <br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">That's convenient, but
dangerous.<br><br>If you use an ankle leash your surfboard can't move
far away. <br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">That means you can be the cause of it hitting you if you
don't move the right way.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> Practice in a swimming pool to get used to
manipulating your leg and the board to grab the board before it hits
you in the head. <br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Being knocked unconscious by a surfboard is easy
and, as you're often reminded, you can drown in a foot of
water.<br><br>Develop into a strong swimmer, watch the ocean and stay
alert. <br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Your odds of drowning will be very low.<br>Also, make sure you
have the right sun protection swimwear gear, to be protected again
the sun UV radiation and its damaging effect on your skin.</p>
