<p>  it's not convenient and it's not fair </p>

<p> you fear the world too much </p>

<p> you've changed. </p>

<p>You mean to say you took them down while he was lying there</p>

<p>somebody was fool enough to put it on him, to be buried in, but I took it, of him</p>

<p>he frightened everyone away while he was alive</p>

<p>only to profit us</p>

<p>did you do all this things?</p>

<p>/</p><p></p>
<p>Would I be disturbing you, if I, joined you?</p>

<p> please, disturb me</p>

<p>About the psychology of the criminal. The "why?" </p>

<p>sometimes things hide in plain sight</p>

<p>you expect us to believe...?</p>

<p>..it's just that sometimes when I speak so forcefully, people just crack, instantly.</p>

<p>Now, let me, reconstruct the crime.</p>

<p>You came into the room when?</p>

<p>And what was the first thing you did?</p>

<p>The moon that night was so beautiful. It made me close to the Lord</p>

<p>i'm picking up on something. You're very spiritual man , aren't you?</p>

<p>It's part of my job, to read people. I think i'm quite good, at it too.</p>

<p>Ahh, you know if you organized your closets by color, it would save you time, in your rush to get to work in the morning </p>

<p>it's what I do , and it saves me time.</p>

<p>Now, in order, to better visualize the crime, i'm going to place myself, in your position</p>

<p>I walk out on to the balcony</p>

<p>I am now out on the balcony</p>

<p>now, you see why it's important to re-create the events</p>

<p>or perhaps, the thief was hiding in a ledge or recess</p>

<p>/<p><p></p>
<p>The art is for me to feed pieces to you and make you believe you, took those pieces, because you are smarter, and I am dumber.</p>

<p>In every game and con there is always an opponent and there is always a victim.</p>

<p>The more control the victim has, the less control he actually has.</p>

<p>I, as the opponent, just help him along.</p>

<p>The formula has infinite depth in it's efficacy and application, but it is staggeringly simple and completely consistent.</p>

<p>Rule one of any game or con: you can only get smarter by playing a smarter opponent.</p>

<p>Eventually , when the opponent is challenged or questioned,it means the victim's investment and thus his intelligence is questioned. No-one can accept that , not even to themselves.</p>

<p>You've got more tricks than a clown's pocket, don't you mr. green?</p>

<p>They're the last resort. when no other loan sharks will lend them, this boys move in.</p>

<p>no-one lives and displeases gold no-one but your two friends</p>

<p>got to be something wrong if gold won't touch'em .</p>
