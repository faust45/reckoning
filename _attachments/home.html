<h1><p>101 Simple Truths We Often Forget</p></h1>

<p>Sometimes we find ourselves running in place, struggling to get ahead simply because we forget to address some of the simple truths that govern our potential to make progress.  So here's a quick reminder:</p>

<p>    The acquisition of knowledge doesn't mean you're growing.  Growing happens when what you know changes how you live.</p>
<p>    You can't have good ideas unless you're willing to generate a lot of bad ones.</p>
<p>    A good idea without action is worth nothing.</p>
<p>    Change is often resisted when it is needed the most.</p>
<p>    Discipline is choosing what you want most over what you want right now.  Read The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.</p>
<p>    People seldom do things to the best of their ability.  They do things to the best of their willingness.</p>
<p>    You can't change other people; you can only offer guidance, and lead by example.</p>
<p>    Right now, there's a lot you don't know.  And if you never challenge your own beliefs, the list will never shrink.</p>
<p>    If you're talking to someone you don't know well, you may be talking to someone who knows way more about the topic of conversation than you do.</p>
<p>    The most common and harmful addiction in the world is the draw of comfort.</p>
<p>    Growth begins at the end of your comfort zone.  Stepping outside of your comfort zone will put things into perspective from an angle you can't grasp now.</p>
<p>    When you spend time worrying, you're simply using your imagination to create things you don't want.</p>
<p>    It's usually only as good or bad as you think it is.  Most of what we see is only what we think about what we see.</p>
<p>    Most of the bad things you worry about will never happen.  Most of the bad things that do happen will have never crossed your worried mind.</p>
<p>    Some circumstances are uncontrollable, but we can always decide how we react to those circumstances.</p>
<p>    Those who complain the most, accomplish the least.</p>
<p>    Whenever somebody discredits you, and tells you that you can't do something, keep in mind that they are speaking from within the boundaries of their own limitations.</p>
<p>    Every problem you have in your life right now is your responsibility, regardless of who initially caused it.</p>
<p>    It's not so much about finding opportunities as it is about creating them.</p>
<p>    Having a plan, even a flawed one at first, is better than no plan at all.</p>
<p>    Paving your own road is intelligent only if nobody has gone exactly where you are going.</p>
<p>    What you do every day matters more than what you do every once in a while.</p>
<p>    What you don't start today won't be finished by tomorrow.</p>
<p>    If you're waiting for the perfect conditions, ideas or plans to get started, you'll never achieve anything.</p>
<p>    Doing something and getting it wrong is at least ten times more productive than doing nothing.</p>
<p>    Putting something off makes it instantly harder and scarier.</p>
<p>    You cannot change what you refuse to confront.</p>
<p>    If you keep doing what you're doing, you'll keep getting what you're getting.</p>
<p>    The harder you work, the luckier you will become.</p>
<p>    Kindness and hard work together will always carry you farther than intelligence.</p>
<p>    Lots of successful people have failed as many times as they have succeeded.</p>
<p>    Failures are simply lessons that help you prepare for next time.</p>
<p>    Being successful is a journey, not a destination.</p>
<p>    To be successful does not mean you have to dominate others; it means you have to dominate your own potential.</p>
<p>    Your success isn't just about you.  It's about how you positively impact the lives around you.</p>
<p>    Being busy and being productive are two different things.</p>
<p>    Being happy and being successful are two different things.</p>
<p>    You have every right to be happy, but it's up to YOU and only YOU to exercise that right.  Read Stumbling on Happiness.</p>
<p>    Everyone you meet is better than you at something.  We all have different strengths.  What worked for someone else might not work for you.</p>
<p>    When you're worried about what others think of you, you're really just worried about what you think of yourself.</p>
<p>    The bad news: nothing is permanent.  The good news: nothing is permanent.</p>
<p>    You don't have to settle.  It's simply a choice you make every day.  If you don't like your life, then it's time to start making changes and better choices.</p>
<p>    There's no such thing as 'risk free.'  Everything you do or don't do has an inherent risk.</p>
<p>    No matter how smart you are, you will make mistakes.</p>
<p>    Problems, when they arise, are rarely as painful and hurtful as the process of fearing them.</p>
<p>    Confusion isn't a bad thing.  It means you're growing and thinking.</p>
<p>    Just because you can doesn't mean you should.</p>
<p>    In the beginning, you need to say "yes" to a lot of things to discover and establish your goals.  Later on, you need to say "no" to a lot of things and concentrate on your goals.</p>
<p>    Even if it doesn't cost any money, it's not free if it takes up your time.</p>
<p>    No matter how you make a living or who you think you work for, you only work for one person, yourself.  The big question is:  What are you selling, and to whom?</p>
<p>    Money makes life easier only when it's yours free and clear.  The stress of financial debt can change a person.</p>
<p>    The fewer possessions you own, the more you will use and enjoy them.</p>
<p>    Life is not easy, especially when you plan on achieving something worthwhile.</p>
<p>    There is good reason why you should wake each morning and mindfully consider what and who you will give your day to:  Because unlike other things in life - love, money, respect, good health, hope, opportunities, and many more - time is the one thing you can never get back once it's gone.</p>
<p>    Cutting your losses is often better than the alternative.</p>
<p>    We sometimes do things that are permanently foolish just because we are temporarily upset.</p>
<p>    Screaming at people always makes things worse.</p>
<p>    Everyone likes a person who gets straight to the point.</p>
<p>    First impressions are oftentimes inaccurate judgments of a person's true character.</p>
<p>    When you're up, your friends know who you are.  When you're down, you know who your friends are.</p>
<p>    If someone wants you in their life, they'll make room for you.  You shouldn't have to fight for a spot.</p>
<p>    When someone truly loves you, they don't ever have to say a word.  You will be able to tell simply by the way they treat you over the long-term.</p>
<p>    We rarely lose friends, we usually just figure out who our real ones are.</p>
<p>    Just because one person doesn't seem to care for you, doesn't mean you should forget about everyone else who does.</p>
<p>    Family isn't always blood.  They're the people in your life who want you in theirs - the ones who would do anything to see you smile and who love you no matter what.</p>
<p>    Good looks attracts the eyes.  Personality attracts the heart.</p>
<p>    In human relationships, distance is not measured in miles but in affection.  Two people can be right next to each other, yet miles apart.</p>
<p>    Being nice to someone you dislike doesn't mean you're fake.  It means you're mature enough to control your emotions.</p>
<p>    If you aren't happy being single, you won't be happy in a relationship.  You have to create your own life first before you can share it with someone else.</p>
<p>    Whenever you hate someone or something, you are giving that person or thing a piece of your heart.  Read The Road Less Traveled.</p>
<p>    Life is too short to spend time with people who suck the happiness out of you.</p>
<p>    It's better to be alone than to be in bad company.</p>
<p>    Saying "no" to right people gives you the time and resources required to say "yes" to right opportunities.</p>
<p>    When you stop chasing the wrong things you give the right things a chance to catch you.</p>
<p>    You can raise the bar or you can wait for others to raise it.  Either way, it's getting raised.</p>
<p>    In life you get what you put in.  If you want love, give love.  If you want friends, be friendly.  If you want money, provide value.  It really is this simple.</p>
<p>    Cynicism might seem warranted at times, but it's never useful.</p>
<p>    Everyone dies, some sooner than later, and often unexpectedly.  To know this means you are alive, with a chance to make the time you have left count.</p>
<p>    You are in competition with one person and one person only - yourself.  You are competing to be the best you can be.</p>
<p>    Trying to be somebody you're not is a sure path to self-hate, and a waste of the person you are.</p>
<p>    It's better to be disliked for who you are than to be liked for who you are not.</p>
<p>    Giving up doesn't always mean you're weak, sometimes it means you are strong enough and smart enough to let go.</p>
<p>    Sometimes you need to distance yourself to see things clearly.</p>
<p>    You can't make the same exact mistake twice. The second time you make it, it's no longer a mistake, it's a choice.</p>
<p>    Not getting what you want is sometimes a wonderful stroke of luck.</p>
<p>    You never have to deal with more than one moment at a time.</p>
<p>    Many of the greatest lessons we learn in life we don't seek on purpose.</p>
<p>    You have to fight through some bad days to earn the best days of your life.</p>
<p>    A harsh fact of life:  Bad things do happen to good people.</p>
<p>    Regardless of the situation, the sun rises the next day and life goes on.</p>
<p>    You never know how strong you really are until being strong is the only choice you have.</p>
<p>    We end up regretting the things you did NOT do far more than the things you did.</p>
<p>    We meet no ordinary people in our lives.  If you give them a chance, everyone has something amazing to offer.</p>
<p>    Every passing face on the street represents a story every bit as compelling and complicated as yours.</p>
<p>    People are not as beautiful as they look, as they walk, or as they talk.  They are only as beautiful as they love, as they care, and as they share.</p>
<p>    Silence is often the loudest cry.  So pay attention to those you care about.</p>
<p>    Making one person smile can change the world.  Maybe not the whole world, but their world.</p>
<p>    Blowing out another's candle will not make yours shine brighter.</p>
<p>    No matter how many mistakes you make or how slow you progress, you are still way ahead of everyone who isn't trying.</p>
<p>    Things turn out best for people who make the best out of the way things turn out.</p>
<p>    Life is short.  If there was ever a moment to follow your passion and do something that matters to you, that moment is now.</p> <br>


<p><b>How not to drown while surfing</b></p>

<p></p><p></p><br>
<p>First, respect that the ocean is stronger than you are. The force of even an average swell is far greater than anyone can resist.That's why it carries you along. But when those get to a certain point, they'll carry you down.</p>
<p>Don't go surfing when the conditions are greater than you can handle. Don't push the limits until you're very experienced.</p>

<p>Next, be aware of the ever changing patterns in the water. Riptides can appear seemingly out of nowhere. Sometimes they're just an inconvenience, dragging you down the beach away from the spot on shore you want to reach.</p>

<p>But, those surface currents can also drag you out to sea, especially if you're fatigued.Stay strong and get out of a rip current as soon as you sense it.</p>

<p>They're not difficult to spot if you're alert. They appear as calm flows, usually as a strip or channel within surrounding turbulent water.The color will often appear slightly different. They don't drag you under, but they can put you far enough out that you can't return to shore. </p>

<p>Then you tire before reaching safety and go under. Swim or paddle parallel to the shore until you're out of it, then return to shore if you're tired.Undertow is similar, but in this case the water flow is under the surface.</p>

<p>When you're on your board that's not usually a problem.But if you fall, you'll often go far enough to reach it, and it can drag you down further and away from the shore.</p>

<p>Again, try to swim parallel, at the same time rising to reach the surface.Swimming directly up makes it harder to reach the surface.</p>

<p>One of the more likely problems that can lead to drowning while surfing is being hit with your board.</p>

<p>Even the most advanced surfers fall of their surfboards at some time.</p>

<p>It's difficult, but necessary, to be alert when you're on the way into the water.Try to note which way your board is moving. When you return to the surface, don't assume your board has floated away.</p>

<p>The board is almost as likely to move back toward you as away from you.That's convenient, but dangerous.</p>

<p>If you use an ankle leash your surfboard can't move far away.That means you can be the cause of it hitting you if you don't move the right way.</p>

<p>Practice in a swimming pool to get used to manipulating your leg and the board to grab the board before it hits you in the head.</p>

<p>Being knocked unconscious by a surfboard is easy and, as you're often reminded, you can drown in a foot of water.Develop into a strong swimmer, watch the ocean and stay alert.Your odds of drowning will be very low.</p>

<p>Also, make sure you have the right sun protection swimwear gear, to be protected again the sun UV radiation and its damaging effect on your skin.</p><br>


<h1><p>28 Ways to Stop Complicating Your Life</p></h1>

<p>Life is not complicated.  We are complicated.  When we stop doing the wrong things and start doing the right things, life is simple.

So starting today..<p>

<p>       Stop berating yourself for being a work in progress. - Start embracing it!  Because being a work in progress doesn't mean you're not good enough today.  It means you want a better tomorrow, and you wish to love yourself completely, so you can live your life fully.  It means you're determined to heal your heart, expand your mind and cultivate the gifts you know you're meant to share. May we all be works in progress forever, and celebrate the fact that we are!!</p>
<p>    Stop doing immoral things simply because you can. - Start being honest with yourself and everyone else.  Don't cheat.  Be faithful.  Be kind.  Do the right thing!  It is a less complicated way to live.  Integrity is the essence of everything successful.  When you break the rules of integrity you invite serious complications into your life.  Keep life simple and enjoyable by doing what you know in your heart is right.</p>
<p>    Stop meaning what you don't say. - Start communicating clearly.  Don't try to read other people's minds, and don't make other people try to read yours.  Most problems, big and small, within a family, friendship, or business relationship, start with bad communication.  Someone isn't being clear.</p>
<p>    Stop wasting time and money trying to acquire more of everything. - Start focusing on quality.  High quality is worth more than any quantity, in possessions, friends and experiences.  Truly 'rich' people need less to be happy.  Live a comfortable life, not a wasteful one.  Too many people buy things they don't need with money they don't have to impress people they don't know.  Do not spend to impress others.  Do not live life trying to fool yourself into thinking wealth is measured in material objects.  Manage your money wisely so your money does not manage you.  Read The Millionaire Next Door.</p>
<p>    Stop spending time with negative people. - Start spending time with nice people who are smart, driven and likeminded.  Relationships should help you, not hurt you.  Surround yourself with people who reflect the person you want to be.  Choose friends who you are proud to know, people you admire, who love and respect you - people who make your day a little brighter simply by being in it.  Life is too short to spend time with people who suck the happiness out of you.  When you free yourself of negative people, you free yourself to be YOU - and being YOU is the simplest way to live.</p>
<p>    Stop trying to change people. - Start accepting people just the way they are.  In most cases it's impossible to change them anyway, and it's rude to try.  So save yourself from needless stress.  Instead of trying to change others, give them your support and lead by example.</p>
<p>    Stop being lazy and cutting corners. - Start avoiding future headaches by doing things right the first time.  Always put your best foot forward.  Doing the best at this moment puts you in the best place for the next moment.  Why give less than 100%?  Life is too short to waste it by living below your full potential.  If something is worth doing, then it's worth doing well.</p>
<p>    Stop procrastinating. - Start taking action and making changes.  Action and change are often resisted when they're needed most.  Get a hold of yourself and have discipline.  Discipline is choosing what you really want over what you want right now.  Putting something off makes it instantly harder and scarier.  What we don't start today won't be finished by tomorrow.  And there's nothing more stressful than the perpetual lingering of an unfinished task.</p>
<p>    Stop worrying and complaining. - Start focusing on the things you can control and do something about them.  Those who complain the most accomplish the least.  And when you spend time worrying, you're simply using your imagination to create things you don't want.  It's usually only as good or bad as you think it is.</p>
<p>    Stop being dramatic. - Start spending less time gossiping about problems and more time helping yourself and others solve them.  Stay out of people's needless drama and don't create your own.</p>
<p>    Stop trying to be everything to everyone. - Start focusing on being everything to someone.  Helping or pleasing everyone is impossible.  But making one person smile can change the world.  Maybe not the whole world, but their world.  So narrow your focus and be yourself.</p>
<p>    Stop making promises you can't keep. - Starting under-promising and over-delivering on everything you do.  Period.</p>
<p>    Stop blaming others. - Start accepting responsibility for everything in your life.  Blaming others accomplishes nothing and prolongs the complications you're facing.  Either you own your problems, or they will own you.  Your choice.  When you blame others for what you're going through, you deny responsibility - you give up your power over that part of your life.</p>
<p>    Stop reacting without a plan. - Start planning and working toward specific goals.  Make a list of your top 3 - 5 goals.  What's most important to you?  What do you value most?  What 3 - 5 things do you most want to do in your life?  Simplifying your life starts with these priorities, as you are trying to make room in your life so you have more time for these things.  Having a plan, even a flawed one at first, is better than no plan at all.  There is good reason why you should wake each morning and mindfully consider what and who you will give your day to: Because unlike other things in life - love, money, respect, good health, hope, opportunities, etc. - time is the one thing you can never get back once it's gone.</p>
<p>    Stop confusing 'being busy' with 'being productive.' - Start tracking and measuring your progress.  Being busy and being productive are two very different things.  Results are more important than the time it takes to achieve them.</p>
<p>    Stop over-committing and trying to do too much at once. - Start saying "no" more often.  If you never say "no," you will take on too much and get nothing accomplished.  In the beginning, you need to say "yes" to a lot of things to discover and establish your goals.  Later on, you need to say "no" to a lot of things and concentrate on your goals.  Once your goals are established, focus on doing one thing at a time and doing it well.  Also, leave space around commitments in your day.  Whether you have appointments, or things you need to do, don't stack them back-to-back.  Leave a little space between things you need to do, so you will have room for contingencies, and you'll go through your day much more relaxed.</p>
<p>    Stop being inefficient simply because you've always done it that way. - Start opening your mind to making positive changes.  If you keep doing what you're doing, you'll keep getting what you're getting.  Many times we live with unplanned, complex systems in our lives simply because we haven't given them much thought.  Instead, streamline your life by finding better ways of handling common tasks.  Focus on one system at a time (your cleaning system, your errands system, your paperwork system, your email system, etc.) and try to make it simplified, efficient, and logical.  Then, once you have it perfected, stick to it.  Read Getting Things Done and The Power of Less.</p>
<p>    Stop cluttering your space. - Start clearing clutter.  Get rid of stuff you don't use and then organize what's left.  If you have a cluttered living or working space, it can be distracting and stressful.  A clear space is like a blank canvas, available to be used to create something great.  Getting truly organized and clutter-free can vastly improve anyone's life.</p>
<p>    Stop overloading your mind by consuming useless information. - Start unsubscribing from useless e-lists and news feeds, and keep the TV off.  Limit your time on Facebook, Twitter, CNN.com and your other favorite websites, etc.</p>
<p>    Stop obsessing over the past and future. - Start being present. Paying more attention to the current moment can make a huge difference in simplifying your life.  It keeps you aware of life, of what's going on around you and within you.  It does wonders for your sanity and stress levels.</p>
<p>    Stop waiting for things to be perfect. - Start thinking of how many things don't get done in this world simply because people are waiting for the perfect time, place and circumstance.  If you're waiting for the perfect conditions, ideas or plans to get started, you'll never achieve anything.  A good idea without action is nothing at all.  Keep it simple and just start.  Focus on the next positive step forward.</p>
<p>    Stop focusing so much energy on trying to avoid mistakes. - Start learning from your mistakes, then smile and move on.  No matter how smart you are, you will make mistakes.  Trying to avoid them will only waste time and complicate your life.  There is a lesson in every mistake you make, and learning the lesson is how you move forward.</p>
<p>    Stop making emotional decisions. - Start taking a few steps back so you can think things through.  When you're caught up in the moment and your emotions are soaring, you're bound to make poor decisions that will lead to needless complications.  The best advice here is simple:  Don't let your emotions trump your intelligence.  Slow down and think things through before you make any big decisions.</p>
<p>    Stop being unhealthy. - Start taking care of your body.  Start sleeping eight hours every night.  A tired, malnourished mind is over-stressed and rarely productive.  Your health is your life, don't let it go.  Eat right, exercise and get an annual physical check-up.  The The 4-Hour Body is an insightful and entertaining read on this topic.</p>
<p>    Stop holding on to intimate relationships that make you unhappy. - Start looking out for yourself when it comes to intimate relationships.  It's better to WAIT, and give your hand to someone who will never let go, rather than holding on to the outside of a hand that has never fully opened for you.  If someone wants you in their life, they'll make room for you.  You shouldn't have to fight for a spot.  Never, ever insist yourself to someone who continuously overlooks your worth.  Remember, anyone can come into your life and say how much they love you.  But it takes someone really special to stay in your life and show you how much they love you.  So slow it down.  True love is worth the wait.</p>
<p>    Stop holding on to hate. - Starting letting hate go!  Keep your sights set on the future.  Holding on to hate and anger is like grasping hot coals with the intent of throwing them at someone else - you are the one who gets burned.  If you want to forget someone, and move on, you must give up hating them.  It's hard to forget someone you hate, because hate takes pieces of your heart - thereby keeping this person within your heart.  If you want to forget them, let go of the hate, and create peace in your heart instead.  Also, remember that whenever you hate something, it usually hates you back: people, situations, and inanimate objects alike; which will only further complicate your life.</p>
<p>    Stop pretending like you know everything. - Start accepting the fact that there's a lot you don't know.  Nobody has it all figured out.  Nobody knows more than a minuscule fraction of what's going on in the world.  Why?  Because the world is simply way too vast for any one person to know everything well.  And most of what we see is only what we think about what we see.  The sooner you accept this, the sooner you will stop making the same unnecessary mistakes, and the sooner new doors of opportunity will open in your life.</p>
<p>    Stop giving what you don't want to receive. - Start practicing the golden rule.  If you want love, give love.  If you want friends, be friendly.  If you want money, provide value.  It works.  It really is this simple.    </p>
